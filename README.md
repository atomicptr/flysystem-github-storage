# flysystem-github-storage

A GitHub based filesystem for Flysystem, powered by [php-github-api](https://github.com/KnpLabs/php-github-api).

**Note**: Keep in mind that GitHub has a rate limit, so if you need a lot of file operations you might
need something else.

Inspired by [@RoyVoetman/flysystem-gitlab-storage](https://github.com/RoyVoetman/flysystem-gitlab-storage).
